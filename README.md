# Guess-the-number
Guess the number in JavaScript.
Guess the number is a game in which the player has to guess a number between 0 and 100.
If the player enters a number smaller than the one he has to guess,
the game will inform him of this,
this also happens if the number is higher than the one he has to guess.
